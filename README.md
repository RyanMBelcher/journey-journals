# Journey Journals

## Description

Traveling is a favorite hobby of many people the world over. And why wouldn't it be? There is no shortage of beautiful and interesting places across our planet. Whether you prefer exploring nature in a National Park or prefer adventures in an urban environment or a mixture of both, there is nothing quite like packing up your bags a getting away for a bit. The thing with traveling is, most of us want to be able to share with others what we are up to. We also want to be able to connect with fellow travelers to see what they are up to or get inspiration for where our next journey should take us. Obviously there is no shortage of social media apps out there where you can share travel adventures and follow other travelers, but so often your feed gets clogged with memes, cat photos, and politics. You've probably often thought to yourself how great it would be to have a social media app that focuses just on travels. Well, that is where Journey Journals comes in. 

With Journey Journals, you will be able to share all your travel adventures with friends, family, and like-minded adventurers. 

User Story:

As a person who loves to travel, I want to be able to post information about my own trips as well as see where other people are traveling, so that I can better plan my future trips, meet other avid travelers, and have a place to store my memories.
